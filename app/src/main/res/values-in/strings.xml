    <string name="statement">We write down shopping lists, notes for conversations, packing lists for vacations or friends\' birthdays. These are all good things so that we don\'t forget them. It\'s very similar with God, he writes down our good and bad deeds and saves them. God is above everything and simply knows everything. God loves people and wants to have fellowship with them. But this is only possible if we are seen by God as blameless. Through faith in Jesus Christ, our bad deeds (our guilt) are wiped out before God. Jesus Christ atoned for our guilt on the cross of Calvary. Every person who accepts this is entered in the book of life forever. Are you registered in the book of life?</string>
    <string name="rev20_12">And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne; and books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according to their works. Revelation 20:12</string>
