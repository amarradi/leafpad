    <string name="what_is_leafpad">Leafpad is a simple app for taking notes.</string>
    <string name="leafpad_work">Leafpad saves all data locally on your smartphone. The notes or metadata such as date and time are not stored in any cloud and are not shared with anyone. No text analysis is carried out either. The notes belong to you. You decide what you do with them.</string>
    <string name="rev20_12">And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne; and books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according to their works. Revelation 20:12</string>
    <string name="statement">We make a note of shopping lists, conversation notes, packing lists for holidays or friends\' birthdays. These are all good things so that we don\'t forget them. Of course, we don\'t write down the bad things, such as bad thoughts, because we don\'t want them to ever come to light. It\'s completely different with God. He writes everything down. After our death, we stand before our Creator and then all things are revealed, the good and the bad. People who are registered in the Book of Life have nothing to fear. Are you registered in the Book of Life?</string>
